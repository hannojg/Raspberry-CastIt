# Raspberry-CastIt
Very simple and yet experimental set-up to use a Raspberry as an online content streamer.

## The scenario & explanation

Share an URL to the Android App (e.g. a Youtube video) or any other of the [supported pages](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/tree/master/youtube_dl/extractor "ALl available Youtube-dl extractor") and let the raspberry play the content for you on a larger screen, e.g. your TV. 
This way I was able to stream to tv shows, series, movies or just custom content over the raspberry to my TV. This way, it has even more compatibility than Google's Chromecast. 

## Advantages 
* Uses on the server side youtube-dl if you like, so it has a very wide compatibility (will be kept updated)
  * See [supported pages](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/tree/master/youtube_dl/extractor "ALl available Youtube-dl extractor")
* Very lightweight

More to come, more to add. Understand this repository as an experimental snapshot, I will extend the repository as I am testing the experiment over time.
