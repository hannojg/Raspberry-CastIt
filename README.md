# Raspberry-CastIt
Very simple and yet experimental set-up to use a Raspberry as an online content streamer.

## The scenario & explanation

Share an URL to the Android App (e.g. a Youtube video) or any other of the [supported pages "ALl available Youtube-dl extractor"](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/tree/master/youtube_dl/extractor) and let the raspberry playthe content for you on a larger screen, e.g. your TV. 
This way I was able to stream to tv shows, series, movies or just custom content over the raspberry to my TV. This way, it has even more compatibility than Google's Chromecast. 

More to come, more to add. Understand this repository as an experimental snapshot, I will extend the repository as I am testing the experiment over time.
